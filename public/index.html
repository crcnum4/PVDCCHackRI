                        <p class="collapse-group">Play as Yukai Renai, a simple farmers daughter that when her home is attached by an ether beast finds that she has the power to absorb surrounding ether and generate a blade of pure ether from her hand. Absorbing the ether around her she is able to manipulate the elements and even absorb powers from bests. Yukai is known as an Ether knight, a warrior at heart with the power to absorb Ether. Yet, apparently Yukai also has the power to absorb Dark Ether, a new Ether Energy found to be toxic to the Ether humans currently use for civilization. <span class="readMore"><br />Read more...</span><span class="collapse">Yukai can absorb this new Ether Energy and turn it against the Dark Ether Beasts.<br/><br />This ability shows that Yukai is her homelands only wy of keeping their current lifestyle. The Dark Ether Beasts being toxic to the current Ether technology means that current weaponry other then physical swords and arrows have little to no effect. The Ethertech weaponry has no effect on the Dark Ether Beasts and it is up to Yukai to defeat the Dark Ether beasts. To learn where they came from and to put an end to them. All the while seeing how the world lives with and experiences Ether and the monsters surrounding them.</span> <span class="readLess hidden"><br />Read less</span></p>

                        <p class="collapse-group">In the world of Callburn an enrgy known as Ether is condensed into crystals. These crystals contain the raw Ether energy which along with the material of the crystal can harness the elements of the earth. Garnet or an Ember Ether crystal has a natural heat and warmth to it. It is used to warm houses and it heavily saturated crystals used in cooking ovens. Aquamarine or Oceanic Ether Crystals are cool to the touch and are used to preserve foods they also can be used to attract water and seem to generate water themselves when instead <span class="readMore"><br />Read more...</span><span class="collapse"> they are able to condense the water in the air and earth around it.  Moonstone or the Craig Ether Stone seems to vibrate naturally. It seems to cause treamors in the earth and is primarily used for aggriculture.<br /><br />
                            Using these stones and more the world is an ethertech civilization. A merging of Ether crystals and technology. While other use the crystals to mimic magic abilities the most practiced can appear to hurl fire balls and bolders. Others have found ways of using the crystals to heal others. Explore a world torn between science and magic, machine and spirit</span> <span class="readLess hidden"><br />Read less</span></p>

                        <p class="collapse-group">The world of Callburn has always been inhabited by monsters and beats of all sizes and aggresion. Humans have mostly lived a very nomadic and dangerous life. Humans were always on the brink of extinction until the discovery of the moonstone or Purity Ether Crystal. This crystal seemed to have the ability to repel the beasts and those who entered the crystals area would be weakended. This gave the humans a chance in the world. They started to develop bases near caves and eventually staarted making mines of their own searching <span class="readMore"><br />Read more...</span><span class="collapse">for more of the Moonstones full of Ether Energy. The more energy in the crystal the larger the protected area. The crystals weree very rare though and so the kingdom of Cristallum was born to monitor and distribute the crystals.<br /><br />The world of Callburn is still a very dangerous place. Leaving the protection of a town or fort opens you to large beats and monsters of every kind. Some of which can harness the energies of Ether themselves. Face untold monsters and beasts while you travel the world of Callburn. Meet new people and defend yourself against terrifying beasts. Absorb their powers and strengthen yourself. As Yukai it is your choice to either kill a beast and allow your team mates to get stronger and to get beast parts for fusion and weapon crafting or do you absorb the beasts Ether energy and power up yourself? The choice is yours.</span> <span class="readLess hidden"><br />Read less</span></p>
